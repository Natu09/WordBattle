## About
Throughout this semester, we developed a competitive version of the popular online game “Woordle”. The word game “Woordle” is a guessing game where users have six tries to guess a five-letter word and will be given hints as to how close each guess is. Upon each guess, the color of the tiles will change to indicate how close each character of the five-letter guess was to the word. The color yellow indicates the correct character but wrong location, green indicates the correct character  and correct location, and gray indicates the character is not a part of the word all together (see figure 1 below). Our version of the game allows users (players) to race against one another to see who can guess the correct word first.
